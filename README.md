# My Money Counter

**My Money Counter** is an intermediate-level C++ program designed to help you accurately calculate the total amount of cash you have on hand.

## How It Works

1. ðŸ’µ **Enter Banknotes**: Input the quantity of each type of banknote you possess.
2. ðŸª™ **Enter Coins**: Input the quantity of each type of coin you have.
3. ðŸ’° **Get the Total**: The program calculates and provides the total cash amount.

The final total is saved in the **wallet.txt** file for easy reference. Each entry in this file will be accompanied by the **date of the saving**, allowing you to track changes over time.

### Supported Currencies

Currently, the program operates exclusively with Euro banknotes and coins. In the future, I plan to introduce support for other major currencies.
