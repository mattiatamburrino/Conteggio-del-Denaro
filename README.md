# My Money Counter

This is an intermediate-level C++ program designed to help you accurately calculate the total amount of cash you have on hand.

## How It Works

1. 💵 **Enter Banknotes**: Input the quantity of each type of banknote you possess.
2. 🪙 **Enter Coins**: Input the quantity of each type of coin you have.
3. 💰 **Get the Total**: The program calculates and provides the total cash amount.

The final total is saved in the **wallet.txt** file for easy reference.

## Euro Only

My program currently operates exclusively with Euro banknotes and coins. In the future, I plan to introduce support for other major currencies.

- Euro €
